<h1>Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
At my organization, the research team needs to update the file permissions and directories in the system. I will go into the projects directory and make sure the users have the appropriate permissions and update those necessary to provide a more secure system. The permissions currently do not match the level of authorization provided. Making sure you check the system and update it will help keep it secure. To complete this, I will perform the following tasks. See below 
<br />

<b>Check file and directory details</b> 

The following codes demonstrate how Linux commands were used to update the permissions in the directories in the system files.


In the first line, it describes the command line I used; the remaining line is the output. This code lists all of the contents within the project's directory. I used the ls command combined with the -la option to display all contents including hidden files. The output of my command displays that there is a drafts directory, a hidden file .project_x.txt, and six (6) other files. The first 10 characters in the string represent the permissions the user, group, and other have on each file or directory.
